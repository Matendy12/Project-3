IOT IN CYBERSECURITY

  Internet of Things (IoT) devices are computerized Internet-connected objects, such as networked security cameras, smart refrigerators, and WiFi- 
  capable automobiles.  IoT security is the process of securing these devices and ensuring they do not introduce threats into a network.

TYPES OF IOT SECURITY

  Network Security: Users need to protect their devices against unauthorized access and potential exploitation.
  Embedded: Nano agents provide on-device security for IoT devices. 
  Firmware Assessment: Firmware security starts with assessing the firmware of a protected IoT device.

INDUSTRIES THAT NEED IOT SECURITY

  Large enterprises, industrial, healthcare and device manufacturers

INTENT OF PROJECT

  Abnormal Distribution's intent is to aid cybersecurity defenders (aka Blue Teams) in preventing attacks by producing IDS (Intrusion 
  Detection System) rules to detect malicious traffic against common IoT (Internet of Things) devices. The primary outcome of our team's work in 
  the data engineering track for Project 3 is an interactive Python (Jupyter notebook) using Pandas.  The notebook serves as the core code 
  delivery, employing ETL workflows to optimize the dataset with the objective of generating Suricata rules.
  
ANALYZING DATA USING ETL METHOD

Do you want to gather and analyze IoT data using the ETL method?  You got it!
  Locate a dataset.
  Use Pandas (Jupyter notebook) to extract raw data from the dataset and to transform raw data into a readable table.
    This can help sort and prioritize critical threats to be eliminated.
  The readable table can then be loaded into a PGAdmin database.
  
ETHICS

Privacy and security concerns

As IoT devices collect vast amounts of personal and sensitive information, the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and surveillance increases.  Individuals may unknowingly share their personal data, leading to potential misuse or exploitation.
